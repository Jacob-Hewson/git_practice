"Hello Git and GitHub" 
Written from the command line of my VM using Vim to write a file called README.txt

Adding some extra text to the read me file which I will then add to the staging area, commit to the local repo and then push remotely to the GitHub repo of the same name.

This will create a new commit log with a key and then I can use the git difftool to view the differences between this commit and the previous one.
